# P1Q1

Generate and plot a continuous-time like sinusoidal signal with a magnitude of 1 and frequency of 4 Hz in the time interval of [0, 1] sec (use an increment of 0.001 sec representing a sampling rate of
1000 Hz which is very high compared to 4 Hz).

# P1Q2

Generate and plot a discrete sinusoidal signal with the same frequency and time interval as before, with various sampling frequencies of 100 Hz, 25 Hz, 15 Hz, 10 Hz and 6 Hz.


# P2Q2
